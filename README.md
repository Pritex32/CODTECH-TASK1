# Diabeties Analysis and prediction

## Dataset Overview:
The project uses a well-known diabetes dataset with columns such as Glucose, BloodPressure, Insulin, BMI, Age, and Outcome,
which are standard features for predicting diabetes risk.

## Data Preprocessing:
The dataset is cleaned by dropping unnecessary columns, removing duplicates, and scaling the features, which is important for models like SVM.

## Model Selection:
- Several classification algorithms were tested: Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM),
- Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. This gives a good comparison of model performances.
  
## Evaluation:
Accuracy scores were calculated for each model, and SVM was selected as the best-performing model with an accuracy of 79.49%.

## Visualizations:
Confusion matrices and scatterplots were generated to visualize model predictions, adding clarity to the evaluation.
